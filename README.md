	> 4 Pose Library Concept and Development		
		Subin's Tutorials - Pose Library Concept and Development in Maya 2016 using Python.
		
		Pose Library is used in production throughout the world by feature animation, vfx and gamming studios. 
		
		Pose library concept and development is used to save, apply, organise and manage different poses. Alone with the corresponding icons 	
		(images). Based on selection it allows you to export and import the pose, more precisely anything that has keyable channel attributes.	

		Development
			1.	Export the pose data to custom format.
			2.	Import the pose data to scene.
			3.	UI design using QT Designer (PyQt4). 
			4.	Organize and manage the folder structure.
			5.	Export module in UI.
			6.	Organize and manage the pose data with icons.
			7.	Import module in UI and scene.
			8.	Blend between the current pose to new pose.
		
		Features:		
			1.	Re-use the pose.
			2.	Works with referenced/unreferenced.
